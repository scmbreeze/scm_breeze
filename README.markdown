### About

These scripts have been refined and incubated in my bashrc for over a year,
and I decided that they deserved their own project.

I've tried to make each section modular, so you are free to choose what parts you want to use.

I also know that we grow attached to the aliases we use every day, so I won't force you to use mine.
I've given some example aliases at `aliases.example.sh`, but please customize them however you like.
